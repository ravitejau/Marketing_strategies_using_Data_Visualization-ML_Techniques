## Marketing strategies for UVW Executives using Data Visualization & Machine Learning Techniques
The Goal of this project is to develop marketing profiles on people which are used for marketing purposes.

Used different visualization techniques like Stacked bar chart, Mosaic plots, histogram to differentiate the given features and to find out
those that are better in discriminating the given data. Trained Decision Trees and Linear SVM to predict the income level of a given user.
The key features that are considered for individuals making less than and more than $50,000 are age, gender, education status, marital status, occupation, etc.

Used DTree_viz libraries to visualize the decision tree (obtained after training the model) using stacked bar charts. Used the 
visualizations to do targeted marketing for reaching out the individuals with different income levels.
